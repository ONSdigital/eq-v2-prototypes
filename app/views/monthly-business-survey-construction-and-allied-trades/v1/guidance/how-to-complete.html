<h1>How to complete this survey</h1>
<p></p>

<ul>
        <li>This survey is for construction businesses and allied trades. If you are a fitter, installer, or have any
                other involvement in construction projects, you are included within the construction industry and so
                should report your figures. <a
                        href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/surveys/informationforbusinesses/businesssurveys/monthlybusinesssurveyforconstructionandalliedtrades"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A full list of allied trades can be found here</a>.
        </li>
        <li>If you have not carried out any work in the reporting period, enter zero values and still submit. Nil
                returns are equally important in producing statistics.
        </li>
        <li>If your total value of work is zero, please explain in the comments section at the end of the survey. This
                will reduce the need for us to contact you with data queries.
        </li>
</ul>

<h2>What you need to do</h2>


<p>You will be asked to provide values for the work you have carried out across three main categories.</p>

<ul><li>Housing work</li><li>Infrastructure</li><li>Non-housing, excluding infrastructure</li></ul>

<p>You will be asked to confirm a total figure for the value of the work your business has carried out during the reporting period.</p>

<p>If you have difficulty in splitting your work across the different categories, then an informed estimate is acceptable.  However, please use a consistent approach for each reporting period.</p>
